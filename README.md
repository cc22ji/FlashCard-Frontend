# Flash Card Generator

This is a pure frontend project which helps us to create various flashcards. 

Here, we do add multiples card in a specified group. This help to maintain different cards in different groups.

Also, we can see throughly details about each card and group as well.

In this, we created three page home page, card page, details page.

In home page we generally create our cards and combine it in one group.
Note that- we cannot create card without creating group.

In card page, we see group name of cards and how much cards a group have.We see the images we put for group name and a button to see the details of every card which is basically render our third page.

In details page, we see every card here and every details about each acrd including term, defination, images.
